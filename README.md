# Dijkstra-Algorithm

Find a shortest path in a simplified public transportation network.

## Tools

Jupyter Notebook

## Description

Using a simplified running schedule, get the adjacency list and use Dijkstra algorithm to find the fastest route to the destination.

**Traffic Network Model.ipynb**A simplified traffic network model is described.

**Adjacency List.ipynb**Algorithm for finding the adjacency list in the model.

**Find Shortest Path.ipynb**The fastest route was found by Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Inputs:   
running schedule

departure station

destination station

travel-start time

### Output:   
fastest route 

arrival time at each station.
